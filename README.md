# RAQ Reusable React Components Library + Storybook

A collection of versatile and reusable React components built with Material-UI (MUI). This library is designed to streamline development by providing ready-to-use components that adhere to RAQ standards, guidelines, and best practices. It ensures a consistent and cohesive user experience across applications. The repository also includes Storybook stories for each component to enhance the development experience.

## Overview

This repository contains the source code for the RAQ Reusable React Components Library along with its corresponding Storybook stories.

- Latest version

  ```plaintext
  1.5.13
  ```

## Prerequisites

- [`Node.js and npm`](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm)

## Integrating the Library (@acl/ui) into Your Project

### Method 1: Using `Azure Artifacts`

#### Setup

1. Add a `.npmrc file` to your project in the same directory as your `package.json`

2. Add the following content to your `.npmrc file`

   ```plaintext
   registry=https://pkgs.dev.azure.com/AdvantasureRAQ/RAQ/_packaging/Prod_v1/npm/registry/
   always-auth=true
   ```

3. Install `vsts-npm-auth` globally if itâ€™s not already installed

   ```bash
   npm install -g vsts-npm-auth --registry https://registry.npmjs.com --always-auth false
   ```

4. Run the following command to add an `Azure Artifacts token` to your user-level `.npmrc file`

   ```bash
   npx vsts-npm-auth -config .npmrc -force
   ```

   - Follow the on-screen instructions. If prompted to log in, use your `entcorecloud account`

- _`Note: Steps 1, 2 and 3 are a one-time setup. Step 4 needs to be run again only if npm gives you a 401 Unauthorized error while installing @acl/ui`_

#### Installation

- Run the following command in your project directory

  ```bash
  npm install @acl/ui
  ```

#### Upgradation

- Run the following command in your project directory

  ```bash
  npm install @acl/ui@latest
  ```

### Method 2: Using a `.tgz` File

#### Setup

1. Download the latest or preferred `.tgz file` from the `release directory`

2. Move it to the directory containing your `package.json`

#### Installation

- Run the following command in your project directory

  ```bash
  npm install ./acl-ui-{version}.tgz
  ```

  - _`Note: Replace {version} with the specific version you want to install (Eg: acl-ui-1.0.0.tgz)`_

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Module not found: Error: Can't resolve '@acl/ui'

1. Delete the `node_modules directory`

2. Delete the `package-lock.json file`

3. Clean up the NPM cache by running the following command in your project directory

   ```bash
   npm cache clean --force
   ```

4. Reinstall all packages by running the following command in your project directory

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

- If the error persists, check all `Webpack and TypeScript configurations` for references to `@acl` and remove them

  ```ts
  "alias": {
    // Delete this line from all the webpack configs(Eg: inside webpack.config.ts)
    "@acl": path.resolve(__dirname, "src/@acl"),
  },
  ```

  ```ts
  "paths": {
    // Delete these lines from all the tsconfigs(Eg: inside tsconfig.json or tsconfig.paths.json)
    "@acl": ["src/@acl"],
    "@acl/*": ["src/@acl/*"],
  }
  ```

## Features

- Run the following command in your project directory to create a `production bundle(dist)` of the components (_excluding `development directory`_)

  ```bash
  npm run build
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to start the `Storybook`

  ```bash
  npm run storybook
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to create a `production bundle(storybook-static)` of the `Storybook`

  ```bash
  npm run build:storybook
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to view the components after importing them inside `src/development/playground/playground.tsx`

  ```bash
  npm run playground
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to execute all unit tests(using Jest) inside `src directory`

  ```bash
  npm run test
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to generate a coverage report for all files inside `src directory` (_excluding `development directory`_)

  ```bash
  npm run test:coverage
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to lint check all files inside `src directory` (_excluding `development/playground directory`_)

  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to format all files inside `src directory`

  ```bash
  npm run format
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to package the build files from the `dist directory` into a `.tgz file` in the `release directory`

  ```bash
  npm run pack:release
  ```

- Run the following command in your project directory to prepare a release by `installing dependencies`, `performing a TypeScript check`, `formatting the code`, `running a lint check`, `building the project`, and `packaging it into a .tgz file` for release

  ```bash
  npm run release
  ```
